Should probably tweak UI so that stuff that's on the right hand side is aligned appropriately
Also should handle window resizing
Haven't implemented much in the way of error handling. Will need to fix that

Should probably add an option to save the results in a more human readable format. Ideally sort by power, possibly against an uninvested neutral Arc.

NOTE
Will probably want to transpose a version of this app into my fork of the damage calc, polish that up a little and then maybe submit a pull request

Consider adding a progress bar or something
Consider scrapping this entirely. I plan on replicating this on the website as well, which would kinda supplant this? Wait nvm, the website one is too limited (e.g. it will restrict to only one set per mon, which isn't totally adequate)

Will be commenting TEST and ISSUE where appropriate. Remove all tests when done with them, while issues should be dealt with eventually. TWEAK is for stuff that works, but is done in a really stupid manner. UNTESTED is purely for when I decide I'm due to back this up to github, but I'm in the middle of working on stuff

===================================================
Current test function now runs through to completion.
>moves/items currently returning the last item in the json data. Only one in the case of moves, despite being meant to use more. This probably holds true for abilities as well
>Spreads is coming up null

Have only tested for 3.41% usg, 4 moves, 1 ability, 1 item, 1 spread. Further testing required. Need to test usg for moves/abilities/items/spreads, ranks for pokemon. Need to test having both rank and usg as criteria. Need to test for multiple entries moves/items/spreads/abilities.
