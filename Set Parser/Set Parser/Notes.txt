Should probably tweak UI so that stuff that's on the right hand side is aligned appropriately
Also should handle window resizing
Haven't implemented much in the way of error handling. Will need to fix that
I suspect the TrimJSON step is doing more harm than good, as this program is taking fkn ages to run. Need to test
Remove ../ from menu select... I'll get to this later

Should probably add an option to save the results in a more human readable format. Ideally sort by power, possibly against an uninvested neutral Arc.



NOTE
Will probably want to transpose a version of this app into my fork of the damage calc, polish that up a little and then maybe submit a pull request

Consider adding a progress bar or something
Consider scrapping this entirely. I plan on replicating this on the website as well, which would kinda supplant this? Wait nvm, the website one is too limited (e.g. it will restrict to only one set per mon, which isn't totally adequate)

Will be commenting TEST and ISSUE where appropriate. Remove all tests when done with them, while issues should be dealt with eventually. TWEAK is for stuff that works, but is done in a really stupid manner. UNTESTED is purely for when I decide I'm due to back this up to github, but I'm in the middle of working on stuff
