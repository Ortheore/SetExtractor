Should probably tweak UI so that stuff that's on the right hand side is aligned appropriately
Also should handle window resizing
Haven't implemented much in the way of error handling. Will need to fix that

Should probably add an option to save the results in a more human readable format. Ideally sort by power, possibly against an uninvested neutral Arc.

NOTE
Will probably want to transpose a version of this app into my fork of the damage calc, polish that up a little and then maybe submit a pull request

===================================================
Currently the pokemon class is extremely bloated with adding stuff for each list. Probably best to create another class that basically consists of a list of usage entities, and then add the appropriate methods to that
